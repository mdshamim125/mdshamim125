I am a front-end web developer proficient in HTML, CSS, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript, and React, with a strong focus on creating responsive and user-friendly web applications. My expertise in modern front-end technologies allows me to craft visually appealing and highly functional user interfaces. Additionally, I have experience with Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, enabling me to build robust server-side applications and RESTful APIs. I am skilled in version control using Git, deploying applications on platforms like firebase, vercel and Netlify, and integrating third-party APIs. With a passion for continuous learning and staying updated with industry trends, I aim to deliver high-quality, efficient, and user-centric web applications, and I am eager to contribute to innovative projects and collaborate with dynamic teams.
